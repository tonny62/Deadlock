# Deadlock

This is a final project contributed to the subject of Operating System at SIIT, Thammasat University.
Semester 2, Academic Year 2016

The project will visualize resorces-allocation-graph then run banker algorithm to solve whether it is is deadlock or not.

The only file that's matter is animation.py. Other files are not used.

The projected used slist as a file structure for searcing nodes of object.
The GUI use tkinter library that comes with python 3.6

The code is not well written, it is quite messy. The comments are sucks. Few bugs that I noticed in the GUI but not yet fixed.
If you want to refractor or reimplement it using better data structure, just do it as it will help you learn a lot in python programming.

# To run program, 
use command 
python3 animation.py
